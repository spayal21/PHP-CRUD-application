# PHP-CRUD-application
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations are fundamental to any web application -
### In PHP, CRUD operations can be performed using the following steps:

1. Connect to the database: To perform CRUD operations, you need to establish a connection to your database. You can do this using the mysqli_connect() function or the PDO object. Here I have prefered PDO .
2. Create data (insert): To add new data to your database, you can use the mysqli_query() function or the PDO object to execute an SQL INSERT statement.
3. Read data (select): To retrieve data from your database, you can use SQL SELECT statement.
4. Update data: To update existing data in your database, you can use SQL UPDATE statement.
5. Delete data: To delete data from your database, you can use SQL DELETE statement.
